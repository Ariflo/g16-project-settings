### Project Settings

These are the steps for any serverside project

- Make a new directory, duh.

	```
	$ mkdir [new_project_name]
	$ cd  [new_project_name]
	```
- If you're using [oh my zsh](http://ohmyz.sh/) then you can both create and cd into your new directory in one command:

	```
	$ take [new_project_name]
	```
	

Great now, you have a new folder and you're set for life, you can find a job, start a family .. 

wait .. What?
